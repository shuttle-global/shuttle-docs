:::note

This document is a work in progress. It is intended to complement the API docs, and provide an easier to understand  walkthrough of the Shuttle platform. It will be padded out over the course of time. In the meantime, the API docs contain all the information required to complete an integration, and feel free to reach out to our team on the provided support channels.
:::


This guide is written for a technical audience, planning or implementing an integration. It is split into several sections:

* Concepts
* Integration

It should be read in conjunction with the API specification [here](https://api.shuttleglobal.com).
